        of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light.

      <p>The purpose of life is not to
        be happy. It is to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some
        difference that you have lived and lived well.

      <p>If you want happiness for an
        hour, take a nap. If you want happiness for a day, go fishing. If you want happiness for a
        year, inherit a fortune. If you want happiness for a lifetime, help somebody.

        gratefully, everyone is blessed.
